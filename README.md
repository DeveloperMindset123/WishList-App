## Notes

Aligning the EditText views and also figuring out how to replace URL links with a placeholder text, links wasn't initially working and internet sources were telling me to set Android:autoLink="all" and android:clickable="true" will fix it but it was interfering with the spannable and URL span logic that I defined in my onBindViewHolder. Nonetheless, it was a good way for me to learn about Recycler View and I enjoyed it.
